# Summaries

## Chapter 13 (Show Progress)

### The tasks that aren’t there

Just because a to do list may have it's items completed it does not mean that all the work is done. It is still possible that there is work that hasn't been outlined yet. For example if they are mid through the sprint or they are waiting for a spike report to be finished. Don't make assumptions without looking into the features themselves.

### Estimates don’t show uncertainty

Estimates are not always concrete. Just because two tasks are estimate the same it does not mean neccesarily that they will take the same amount of time. For example two projects where one has never been done and the other has been completed ten times.

### Work is like a hill

The analogy in this chapter is from a dinner party and the hill represents the progress on the task which is the party. The basics of the analogy is that there is uncertainty in the beginning of the until you reach the known. The beginning might need to research food, venues times, where the completion might entail after the dinner is completed.

### Scopes on the hill

Now to the previous example we can add scopes, they can be described as uphill or downhill during updates.

### Status without asking

The concept in this chapter is that managers can view the status of the project without discussing it within a group or with each developer individually. They can simply access the hill chart on basecamp (a tool they created) and see the lists for each of their developers or more simply the progress on the 'hill'.

### Nobody says “I don’t know”

This chapter addresses the issues of people not being able to communicate or identify if they are stuck. In this example the manager might identify that they are at the peak of the hill and not moving within the last few weeks.

### Prompts to refactor the scopes

Another example that the project might not be progressing towards the completion is that the scopes were not identifed correctly. Perhaps all the plotted points are not being completed. Therefore you may need to redefine the scopes and the points for each developer or each feature.

### Solve in the right sequence

This example from the chapter details the sequence of the tasks completed may be important to the delivery of the whole project. For example the manager could see all the points progressing or moving linearly or synchronosly. They may also be able to identify if the project is held up at a certain point or if may not be completing on time.

## The Scrum Guide

The purpose of the scrum guide is to deliver, develop and sustain complex products. It consists of roles, events, artifacts, and rules. It was developed by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

### Definition of Scrum

The definition of scrum is to produce projects with the highest possible value while being both productive and creative. The scum is designed to be lightweight, simple to understand but difficult to master. I would argue personally that is not difficult to master due to my previous experiences during my co-op and school projects.

### Uses of Scrum

Scrum has a long and rich history, it was initially developed in the 1990s for managing and developing products. The main uses were:

- Research markets, technologies, and product capabilities
- Develop products
- Release products, as frequently as possible
- Develop and sustain operational environments
- Sustain and renew products

### Scrum Theory

Scrum is based on empirical process, which basically means that information comes from experience rather than documentation or any resources. There are three important pillars to scrum theory:

Transparency:

- This concept means that people should be able to 'view' the progress of their colleagues or as a manager the developers within your team

Inspection:

- this refers to the consistent keep up of the manager that tracks the progress and actual work of the developers

Adaptation:

- Adaptation refers to when the inspection finds issues that need to be addressed, or when an adjustment needs to be made.

There are four formal events:
Sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, sprint retrospective.

### The Scrum Team

The Scrum team consists of the product owner, the development team and the scrum master.

#### The Product Owner

The product owner is responsible for producing the 'highest possible value' part of the definition of scrum.

- Expressing backlog items
- Ordering the backlog
- Optimizing the values of the items
- Ensuring visibility for all team members
- Ensuring general understanding is reached among all team members

#### The Development Team and Size

- The development team works on it's own, they don't require the scrum master to tell them what to do
- With a similar point they have all the skills necessary to complete their work
- There are no titles in scrum (other than scrum master and product owner lol)
- There are no sub-teams

#### The Scrum Master

Services to the product owner: ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone, finding the most effective techniques to monitor the backlog, understanding product planning, organizing the backlog, and lastly ensuring agility is maintained.

Services to the development team: teaching self organization and cross functionality to the team, helping create high-value products, removing impediments, facilitating scrum and coaching for any other organizational environments that arise.

Services to the organization: Leading or coaching the organization as a whole in scrum, planning the different implementations, helping employees or stakeholders with understanding or inactment of the product, and working with other scrum masters to better help the company as a whole.

### Scrum Events

In Scrum, prescribed events are used to establish regularity and minimize the need for additional, non-defined meetings. All events are time-boxed, with a fixed Sprint duration. While the Sprint is a container for all other events, each event offers a formal opportunity for inspection and adaptation, enhancing transparency. Failing to include these events reduces transparency and misses the chance to inspect and adapt effectively.

### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum in Scrum is a 15-minute daily event held by the Development Team to plan work for the next 24 hours, optimize collaboration, and inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal. It takes place at the same time and place every day, with a focus on achieving the Sprint Goal. The format is flexible, but common questions include discussing what was done yesterday, what will be done today, and addressing any impediments. The Scrum Master ensures the meeting occurs and keeps it within the time-box. The Daily Scrum promotes communication, eliminates extra meetings, identifies and resolves impediments, facilitates quick decision-making, and enhances teamwork.

### Sprint Review

The Sprint Review occurs at the end of a Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog as necessary. It's a collaborative, informal meeting involving the Scrum Team and key stakeholders. The Product Owner explains what's been completed and what hasn't, the Development Team shares successes and challenges, demonstrates the Increment, and answers questions. The group discusses the Product Backlog's status and collaborates on what to do next, offering valuable input for subsequent Sprint Planning. The outcome is a revised Product Backlog that defines probable items for the next Sprint, potentially adjusted to seize new opportunities. This meeting typically lasts up to four hours for one-month Sprints, shorter for shorter Sprints, and the Scrum Master ensures it stays within the time-box.
