## Chapter 13 (Show Progress)

### The tasks that aren’t there

Just because a to do list may have it's items completed it does not mean that all the work is done. It is still possible that there is work that hasn't been outlined yet. For example if they are mid through the sprint or they are waiting for a spike report to be finished. Don't make assumptions without looking into the features themselves.

### Estimates don’t show uncertainty

Estimates are not always concrete. Just because two tasks are estimate the same it does not mean neccesarily that they will take the same amount of time. For example two projects where one has never been done and the other has been completed ten times.

### Work is like a hill

The analogy in this chapter is from a dinner party and the hill represents the progress on the task which is the party. The basics of the analogy is that there is uncertainty in the beginning of the until you reach the known. The beginning might need to research food, venues times, where the completion might entail after the dinner is completed.

### Scopes on the hill

Now to the previous example we can add scopes, they can be described as uphill or downhill during updates.

### Status without asking

The concept in this chapter is that managers can view the status of the project without discussing it within a group or with each developer individually. They can simply access the hill chart on basecamp (a tool they created) and see the lists for each of their developers or more simply the progress on the 'hill'.

### Nobody says “I don’t know”

This chapter addresses the issues of people not being able to communicate or identify if they are stuck. In this example the manager might identify that they are at the peak of the hill and not moving within the last few weeks.

### Prompts to refactor the scopes

Another example that the project might not be progressing towards the completion is that the scopes were not identifed correctly. Perhaps all the plotted points are not being completed. Therefore you may need to redefine the scopes and the points for each developer or each feature.

### Solve in the right sequence

This example from the chapter details the sequence of the tasks completed may be important to the delivery of the whole project. For example the manager could see all the points progressing or moving linearly or synchronosly. They may also be able to identify if the project is held up at a certain point or if may not be completing on time.
