# Summarizations
## Chapter 2  

Shapework is a methodology that was developed by Basecamp. It was originally created to be used by the team and later became their product. It needs to be consice enough to be understood however it cannot be too in depth to avoid confusion and slowing down progress. It is an essential skill for the project manager to be able to find the perfect medium for the team. In the first property (It's rough), the work has not been completed and is in a rough stage. In the second property (it's solved), you continue the progress from the rough stage to refine it. In the third property (it's bounded) the scope is defined and therefore what teams need to complete can be achieved.

## Chapter 3

In the third chapter, we are introduced to the concept of setting boundaries. Also known as setting the appetite, you need to ensure that the team is focused on the same goals, as well as aware of the design and what needs to be achieved to complete it. Even though the team might be aware of what is needed for the design, it is also important to not 'rush into things' too quickly. In terms of scope and time, one concept that is introduced is using a fixed time and a variable scope. This uses similar deadlines to other methodologies which can hinder quality but improve organization. With the shapeup methodology, you area always battleing time constraints which set the expecations for quality. A one week project will not have the same quality as a one month project, despite how organized they might be.

## Chapter 4

In chapter four, finding elements is discussed which means discovering the parts of the solution you want to implement and choosing the correct ones. One thing to keep in mind is to move at the right speed. This entails having the right people and having the right details. Another key strategy to shapeup is breadboarding. This strategy comes from electrical engineering where you create all the correct components to test whether wiring is complete. It doesn't have the full design but you can see that the parts are working. The next strategy is fat marker sketches, where we do somewhat the opposite of breadboarding. Here we try to use a little detail as possible by using 'fat marks' removing the need for small details. Since the project is not deliverable yet, we want to keep it in mind that this is still very much private work that has been completed. Also at this stage you could walk away from the project in theory. 

## Chapter 5

Chapter five discusses how important thoroughly shaping a project before commititing fully to it within a confirmed timeframe. There might be serious risks associated with incomplete timelines or planned project shaping. These issues can be fatal for projects or teams when they lead to budget or time commitement issues. One concept that is discussed is potential issues also known as 'Rabbit Holes'. This is typically during the shaping phase. You can also reduce these issues when the correct decisions are made in terms of design as well as project boundaries. You can also massively benefit when working with technical experts through what you need to assume during the software requirments specifications stage.
