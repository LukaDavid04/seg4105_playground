# Writing a Pitch

37signals' Rework Podcast: Season 2 - Episode 72

## Summarization

A pitch in Shapeup serves as a directive for creating a new feature, focusing on the idea, its significance, possibly involving customer input, and presenting the problem along with a rough plan for its solution. It is a high-level concept, typically composed of around 800 words, incorporating some basic sketches. Importantly, a Shapeup pitch should strike a balance: not overly detailed like a specification but more thought-out than just a simple sentence, avoiding the extremes commonly found in other development approaches.

Pitches are also an essential part of bandcamp shapeup idealogy. The traditional waterfall approach has proven ineffective, while Shapeup takes a different approach by disregarding estimates and emphasizing specifications. Shapeup is characterized by its flexibility, unlike the rigid waterfall method. Effective pitches in Shapeup strike a balance between being informative and adaptable, allowing for anyone to create and explain them. However, crafting a formalized pitch that aligns with Shapeup's principles requires additional effort.

A great an important example outlined in the podcast would be Daniel Pink's three pillars of job satisfaction which encompasses essential elements for creating fulfilling and productive work environments. First, autonomy allows individuals the freedom to devise their own solutions and take ownership of their tasks, fostering a sense of empowerment and self-direction. Second, the pursuit of mastery encourages employees to continuously improve their skills, which not only boosts personal satisfaction but also elevates the quality of project outcomes. Lastly, instilling a sense of purpose in work by highlighting its contribution to larger goals and missions goes a long way in making employees feel like their roles are meaningful and vital, resulting in more gratifying and engaging work experiences.
