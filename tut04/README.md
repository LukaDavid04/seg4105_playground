# Shape Up

Chapters 7-9

## Summarization

### Chapter 7

No Backlogs: Backlogs are a common practice in most work methodologies. However in shape up they are not considered the best practice. They are actually discouraged as they consume time and resources.

A Few Potential Bets: Instead it is recommended to hold a betting table, where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle. They will look at pitches and if nothing is critical to do then time and resources are preserved.

Decentralized lists: This approach encourages departments to independently track their tasks and ideas, reducing the need for a central backlog. Regular cross-departmental meetings help share and prioritize important ideas, ensuring they are relevant and timely. This approach values ideas based on their context and importance.

Important Ideas to Come Back: Essentially, the text highlights that truly important ideas have a way of resurfacing over time. While many ideas may come and go, the ones that matter will return naturally. For instance, if you have a great idea, you're unlikely to forget it. Likewise, recurring issues, even if initially deemed unimportant, will keep coming up, prompting action and consideration for solutions.

### Chapter 8

Existing Products: The goal is to have the team complete and release a version of the new feature within the set development cycle. In this context, the existing code and design that remain unchanged serve as a framework, much like an empty space within a pre-existing house.

The Betting Table: The cool-down meeting is where stakeholders decide what to prioritize in the next development cycle. They consider new pitches that have been shaped in the previous six weeks and may also revive one or two older pitches. There's no grooming or backlog; instead, a small team consisting of the CEO, CTO, a senior programmer, and a product strategist review the options in a short, focused meeting. The outcome is a cycle plan that takes into account available resources, business priorities, and recent work. The involvement of top-level executives is crucial to ensure the success of the development cycles, and the meeting serves as a way to control the product's direction rather than a resource allocation battle.

### Chapter 9

R&D Mode: In the early stages of developing a new product, ideas are uncertain, and it's challenging to define them precisely. This uncertainty results in a lot of experimentation and changes in direction. Instead of shaping the product upfront, they mainly invest time in exploring key aspects of the idea. Senior team members, including the CTO and CEO/designer, actively participate in the development to maintain the product's vision and make crucial architectural decisions. The goal is not to ship a finished product in each cycle but to gather insights and create a foundational structure for future work. They iterate cycle by cycle, deciding whether to continue or adjust their approach based on what they learn.

Clean-Up Mode: In the phase leading up to a product launch, known as "cleanup mode," all traditional structure is set aside to address unforeseen issues and fine-tune the product. This phase is marked by a sense of urgency and a heightened awareness of the impending launch. Shaping is abandoned, and leadership takes charge to prioritize essential tasks and eliminate distractions. Team boundaries become fluid, with everyone contributing as needed. Work is continuously integrated into the main codebase in small, disciplined increments. Cleanup mode also serves as the phase for making final decisions on what features to keep, reducing the V1 surface area to minimize complexity and ensure a smoother launch.
